# Jumpy Duke The Game!
![](assets_to_be_packed/DukeThree.png)

## Description

### What?

An interactive platform game inspired by Flappy Bird.
You fly around with Java's own Duke and try to catch bugs and avoid obstacles.
Simple but elegant. The space key is almost the only one you need to keep an eye on.

In the game you get points, which are saved online in a MySQL database connected to the game and the website
through a NodeJS-Express routing application.

The application and the website can be found at this repository:

### Why?

This project was made as an assignment for a course in Agile Software Development.

We were given the task of creating a game in the style of Flappy Bird and work according to Scrum methods.

The goal was to practice planning, structure and cooperation and to 
hopefully get a taste of what it's like in a real commercial project.
